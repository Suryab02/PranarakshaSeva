# PranarakshaSeva
Pranaraksha Seva is a comprehensive and professionally designed web application aimed
at providing efficient and convenient access to essential healthcare services. Developed
using the React framework, the application offers a range of features including real-time
information on blood availability, medical resources, and ambulance services. The Login
component plays a crucial role in the application, allowing users to sign in as either guests
or administrators. This distinction grants users access to specific functions based on their
role, ensuring secure and controlled access to the system.
One of the key functionalities of Pranaraksha Seva is the GuestServices component, which
enables users to check the availability of blood, verify doctor information, and request an
ambulance. Through the integration of Axios, the application fetches data asynchronously,
ensuring that users receive the most up-to-date and accurate information. The seamless
integration of database technologies allows for efficient data retrieval and storage,
ensuring the reliability and responsiveness of the application.
